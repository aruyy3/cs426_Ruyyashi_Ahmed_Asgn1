I like the checker template specially on floors so I imported an image and sticked it to the floor of my game, I add cubes to close up the map and not let the bullets go through them. I uploaded the images on cubes that I compressed to make it almost flat and sticked them to the wall. then i put the targets under them so i get 1 point of score after each image. then added the third target at the middle of the map to complete the assignment requirments. 
I used the same code files from tutorial 1.
